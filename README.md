#### User stories
User(s) will be presented with a game board that is comprised of 42 board divisions (cells) 7 rows high & six columns wide. 
The first user may hover over & click on any cell to enter their move. 
The second user may then hover over & click on any other cell to enter their move. 
This is repeated until one user completes 4 or more of their pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in which case that user wins. 
Users will be notified who won. 
The game can be reset at any time to clear the board to play again.
